# What is whats-next?

Have you ever been in a situation when you pass an input and get a fixed output that is different for different inputs?

How can you find a formula that will give you the result when passed the input?

That's when you can use whats-next. Whats next studies the inputs and outputs and calculates a formula for you. This can be very helpful when studying an unseen phenomenon and help you figure out what is actually happening.

I welcome any suggestions and pull requests. Thank you!
